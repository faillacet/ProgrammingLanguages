Overall, this assignment was both easy and difficult.  I personally had little trouble completing part two and was able to finish quite quickly.  However, Part 1 of this assignment was very difficult and hard for me to piece together.  After going to office hours with Dan I was able to piece together a lot fo the concepts that I did not understand before and with the help of classmates, eventually I was able to complete everything in the assignment.  Specifically, the first major roadblock I ran into was implemented all the conversion functions.  This confusion mostly stemed from recusion and general haskell syntax.  After conversing with classmates and figuring out how to do these things everything else started to fall into play.  I tested my programs with the given test cases as well as a few other self-generated simple test cases that helped me check if functions worked or not.  I learned a lot over the course of this assignment and got a lot more comfortable with functional programming.  Although I am still not very good with it, Haskell no longer feels as foreign as it did at the begining of the semester.  One confusion I am left with after completing this assignment is exactly how what we created ties into the idea of a programming language.  A lot of the things required for this calculator to run were sort of swept under the rug and that leaves gaps in my full understand of how the program works.  However, I now have a gist of how a programming language incorporates data types and how recursion can be used to make these data types universally helpful.

Side note: The majority of functions for part1 were done in office hours on 10/3, so they all came under one git commit
