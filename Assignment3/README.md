# Critical Apprasial

* Trenton Faillace

* In my opinion, this assignment was the easiest out of the three.  In the first two assignments I started them feeling lost and by the end I had a solid understanding of the topics at hand.  This assignment was more or less an extension of the same topics we have been learning (lambda calculus) n an haskell interpreter.  The only confusion I had was with the syntax, but I was able to understand this by looking at the examples and the documentation within the readme.  I am very comfortable with c++ and pointers, so understand the circular lists conceptually were pretty easy for me and it was just a matter or translating it to the proper syntax.  Overall the assignment was very intresting and I enjoyed completing it.  I am left with respect for the people who create their own programming languages, as there are so many factors and complicated topics that go into setting the foundations for even the simpliest topics.  Although I have no future plans to create my own entire language, it has inspired me to learn more about the fondations of languages and sytax to better understand how my code is being processes by the compiler.
